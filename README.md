Accessible Facebook UI
====================

An accessible reimplementation of Facebook's core functions, designed to work with eye-tracking technology.


===== TO DO =====

- Implement SimplePost with new architecture
- server.js basic template
- login.js function (with functions for other js files to call for -login info)
- Links to each of the functionality pages from the homepage, no GUI
	-- i.e. link to Status page, simplepost functionality
- Create .html files for each page (can just be stubs)
- Side bars (copy and paste two divs + center div)
